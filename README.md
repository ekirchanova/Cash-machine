This program simulates the operation of an ATM at the stage of working with money.
There are three things it can do:
1) put money
2) withdraw money
3) show state

Consider each one in more detail.

1)Put money

   You need to fill out how many bills of each denomination you want to deposit into the account and click ok
   If all the bills have been deposited, the ATM will return to the main menu.
   If it was not possible to deposit any bills, the ATM will withdraw the amount that could not be deposited.
   
2)Withdraw money

  You need to enter the withdrawal amount and choose whether or not you want to receive small bills.
  If the required amount has been withdrawn, the ATM will return to the main menu.
  If it was not possible to deposit any part of the amount, the ATM will withdraw the amount that could not be withdrawn.
   
3)Show state

  The ATM will display the amount that is stored in it and the number of bills.
